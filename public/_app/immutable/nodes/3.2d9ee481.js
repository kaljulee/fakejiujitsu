# Bridge and Shrimp
* Bridge and Shrimp is a attempt to solve the [Degrees of Freedom Problem](https://youtu.be/Fz31R6sgHZ4) by reducing the number of ways a player moves.

* Fake Jiu Jitsu wants to categorized all movements as either a Bridge or a Shrimp.

* [This steals heavily from Wim Deputter's hip escape (shrimp) and shoulder escape (baby bridge).](https://youtu.be/VhgRVzHv9r8)

* Donâ€™t let them take you out of deadlift position (or equivalent)

If you are in a good, deadlift-like body position and your opponent is stuck out of one, you have a significant advantage.
