# Summary
Connection is related to Priit Mihkelson's clicks and Matt Thorton's connection.


FJJ 2 upgrades Connection from an Exception to a Concern.  It is the least-well-defined Concern.

Connection has two components
* connection to ground
* connection to lab partner

Connection as an Electrical System:
* Benefits from flush connection surfaces
* Connection to the ground can be established through lab partner

Like needed a solid connection between electrical conductors.
