## Summary
Connection is related to Priit Mihkelson's clicks and Matt Thornton's [connection](https://youtu.be/J-zwTwtxOWo).

## Theory
FJJ 2 upgrades Connection from an Exception to a Concern.  It is the least-well-defined Concern.

Connection has two components

* connection to ground
* connection to lab partner

Connection as an Electrical System:

* Benefits from flush connection surfaces
* Connection to the ground can be established through lab partner

## Examples
* [Andy Bisek double underhook](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxTAF8pw7V2FOlArdkYWUpylmm5Peoq7pN)
* [Toes on the mat](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxxgn36k6s8UMXs3-ok-nD7lKpzvOTs2f4)
* [Tai Chi push hands](https://youtu.be/2y_2RyTkiQI)

## General Use

* Active toes are necessary for FJJ2 Connection
* Wim Deputter's [Mannequin Arm](https://youtu.be/t0Iz6dY10kk) is cited as evidence that extended limb position and tensions are important to Connection
