Origin Point is Priit taken quite literally on the zero point.  I define a cluster of positions that is the reference point for everything that is happening in a match.

You must defend your zero point positioning and maneuver your opponent into being out of position.  This is true on bottom and on top, so defense and offense need to be played in all positions.
Origin Point is Priit’s defensive BJJ and Wim Deputter’s Protection of Spinal Alignment

Origin Point Control is arguably more important than leverage to controlling your opponent.

* Don’t let them in turtle space
* Don’t let them take you out of deadlift position (or equivalent)

If you are in a good, deadlift-like body position and your opponent is stuck out of one, you have a significant advantage.
