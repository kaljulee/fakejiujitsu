## Summary
* Origin Point is based on [Priit Mihkelson's zero points](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx-E8gi1nf8pbZdNuTQaa3ZEzBVyFJ822A).
* The Origin Point is used as a reference for mapping jiu jitsu.
* If you have a path back to the Origin, you are probably safe.
* If you're opponent doesn't have a path back to the Origin, he is probably not safe.

## Theory
### The Basic BJJ Navigation Unit: the Technique
The primary navigation unit of BJJ is the Technique (includes positions).  They are understood in reference to each other by differentiation (half-guard is not the same as full guard) and by transition (you can transition to an armbar from bottom closed guard, but not from top closed guard).

Techniques are categorized into submissions, escapes, passes, sweeps, and positions.
Positions are ordered into a hierarchy.  Positions higher up the hierarchy are considered safer.
* example: *Top side control is preferable to Top Half Guard*

Positions are generally considered to be either offensive or defensive in nature.
* example: *Attack from guards, not from Bottom Side Control*
* example: *Defend and escape from bad positions, maintain and attack from good positions*

Techniques are navigated via transition.
* example: *People escape when I go for an armbar from closed guard*

Transitions are described as a series of discrete events in both time and space.
* example: *I got the takedown, then ended up in closed guard, then passed guard into mount, then went for an armbar*

Techniques are generally not reducible or composable, so each must be practiced separately.
* example: *To get good at maintaining Top Mount, Top Half-Guard, and Top Side Control, you must spend time training in each of them*

### The Basic FJJ Navigation Unit: the Point
FJJ has an infinite number of points, all defined by distance and direction from the Origin Point.
If you have the ability to return to the Origin Point, you are safe.  If you do not, you are not safe.

### Comparison of BJJ/FJJ navigation units
| feature | BJJ | FJJ |
| :----- | :-----: | :-----: |
| basic unit | Technique | point |
| number of units | < 1000 | ∞ |
| unit complexity | high | low |
| unique safety checks | < 1000 | 1 |

## General Use

### Grappling Throttle



## BJJ/FJJ Translator

### Submissions are Control Positions

### Defense and Offense Played In All Positions


You must defend your zero point positioning and maneuver your opponent into being out of position.  This is true on bottom and on top, so defense and offense need to be played in all positions.
