    </p><p></p>
    <p>Before explaining what that is, I want to build context (and anticipation), by presenting descriptions of
        Traditional BJJ training
        (TBJJ) and Ecological Dynamics BJJ training (EDBJJ).</p>
    <hr class="svelte-qw8iwt">

    <p>The primary information source is the Professor. Techniques and positions are experienced through three primary
        activties</p>
    <ul><li>class instruction</li>
        <li>no/low resistance drilling</li>
        <li>sparring</li></ul>
    <p>Each activity is most effective when supervised by the Professor, who gives feedback and corrections.</p>
    <p>The student experience does contribute to learning, but the Professor is a necessary source of truth; without his
        corrections, the student is likely to develop malformed and ineffective techniques.</p>
    <hr class="svelte-qw8iwt">
    <div class="img-wrapper svelte-qw8iwt"><img src="/_app/immutable/assets/eco_d_learn.1af8d0dc.jpeg" alt="Ecological Dynamics Learning" class="svelte-qw8iwt"></div>
    <p>Here, the primary source of information is from the student’s experience playing games designed by the coach. The
        coach decides what technique she is trying to get the player to learn, designs a game that encourages behaviors
        that are important to the execution of that technique, then refines the game based on how the player reacts to
        it.</p>
    <p>The player&#39;s development is shaped by the coach&#39;s games, but the lessons learned are generated primarily from the
        player&#39;s personal experience.</p>

    <p>The tester has a model, which makes predictions that are tested in experiments, and a sensor to detect test
        results.</p>
    <p>The model is the set of principles (i.e., getting underhooks on someone is good).</p>
    <p>The experiment is to try go get underhooks on someone and see what happens.</p>
    <p>The sensor is your body: your athletic control, sensitivity to weight changes, awareness of affordances, etc.</p>
    <p>The quality of the information you get is dependent on how finely calibrated your sensor is.</p>
    <p>For example, a novice grappler may find experimental results that are consistent with <i>underhooks not mattering
        at all</i>.</p>
    <p>If this is the data the tester collects, then there is a good chance that her sensor isn&#39;t well-calibrated yet.
        (either that or we&#39;re all wrong about underhooks)</p>
    <p>The experiments serve the dual functions of testing the model and calibrating the sensor. This means there is a
        certain amount of looseness and guesswork in the system, as both the model and the sensor are possible sources
        of error.</p>
    <p>There are three cycles in TDT:</p>
    <ul><li>model updates</li>
        <li>sensor improvements</li>
        <li>partner feedback</li></ul>
    <p>The partner feedback loop is intended to get observations, as opposed to corrections. The ideal partner will
        avoid statements like &quot;you should do this&quot;, instead saying things like &quot;when you do this, I feel this
        opportunity (or lack thereof)&quot;.</p>
    <p>Separating out the body as the sensor may seem unnecessarily pedantic.  Shouldn&#39;t it be assumed that a person&#39;s body is part of developing a grappling skill set, regardless of the approach?  Why not include the bodies of the TBJJ student and the EDBJJ player?</p>
    <p>An important component of TDT is that there is no authoritative outside source of truth.  Without the corrective force of a Professor or a coach, testers need to rely on their own tools to decide what principles are effective.</p>
    <p>&quot;Sensor calibration&quot; still occurs in TBJJ and EDBJJ, but it is not part of how you determine what it is you should be practicing.</p>
    <p>TBJJ in particular does not generally recognize a skill threshold that a student needs to reach before they can decide that the Professor is actually wrong about some things.</p>
    <p>EDBJJ is still in its infancy, and carries many training scars from the days of traditional technique training.  In theory there is room for a player to question the coach&#39;s games and goals, but in practice this is still unusual.</p>
