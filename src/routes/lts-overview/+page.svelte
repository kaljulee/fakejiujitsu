Fake Jiu Jitsu 2 is an semi-scientific training method for learning jiu jitsu.
Instead of taking information from authoritative outside sources, it develops all information in-house, using models and 1st-person experience as the source of truth.

Fake Jiu Jitsus generally consist of a set of fundamentals, more complex principles based on those fundamentals, and exceptions that are outside the model but so universally useful they can't be ignored.
Fake Jiu Jitsu 2 is the current Long-Term-Support version of Fake Jiu Jitsu.
