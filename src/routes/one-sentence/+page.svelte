<p>I have a confession – I quit Brazilian Jiu Jitsu back in 2019.  This might come as a surprise to some, as I continued to train on the mat.  But instead of trying to learn real BJJ, I started faking it.</p>

<p>What does that even mean?  What is Fake Jiu Jitsu?  Before defining it, I think it may be helpful to have a working definition of actual Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, as it is the thing that is generally being faked.</p>

<i>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a set of positions and techniques that are learned, practiced, then deployed in grappling scenarios.</i>
<p>You get taught BJJ, you practice it, and you apply what you’ve learned in live grappling.</p>
<p>In contrast,</p>
<i>A Fake Jiu Jitsu is a set of fundamental principles and behaviors that, when practiced sufficiently, will result in actions that are very difficult to distinguish from actual Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</i>
<p>There is not much to teach in Fake Jiu Jitsu.  You decide on a set of fundamentals, apply them in grappling experiments, then refine your fundamentals based on the results.  Conducting these experiments will result in improved coordination and sensitivity, making you more effective at conducting the experiments.  A virtuous cycle is the result.</p>
<p>I have diagrams to show you on the next page.</p>
