        <p>What does that even mean? What is Fake Jiu Jitsu? Before defining it, I think it may be helpful to have a
            working definition of actual Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, as it is the thing that is generally being faked.</p>

        <i>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a set of positions and techniques that are learned, practiced, then deployed in
            grappling scenarios.</i>
        <p>You get taught BJJ, you practice it, and you apply what youâ€™ve learned in live grappling.</p>
        <p>In contrast,</p>
        <i>A Fake Jiu Jitsu is a set of fundamental principles and behaviors that, when practiced sufficiently, will
            result in actions that are very difficult to distinguish from actual Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</i>
        <p>There is not much to teach in Fake Jiu Jitsu. You decide on a set of fundamentals, apply them in grappling
            experiments, then refine your fundamentals based on the results. Conducting these experiments will result in
            improved coordination and sensitivity, making you more effective at conducting the experiments. A virtuous
            cycle is the result.</p>
        <p><i>Fake Jiu Jitsu</i> is a generic term for this sort of approach to grappling, which I will try to justify in following sections.</p>
        <p><strong>FJJ2</strong>, or <i>Fake Jiu Jitsu 2</i> is a specific implementation of this approach, and the current Long Term Support version of fake jiu jitsu developed by the Nice Train Lab.</p>
        <p>(I have an undergraduate degree in philosophy, so I know how to use confusing terminology responsibly)</p>
        <p>FJJ2 defined in a single sentence:</p>
        <p class="definition">Using <strong>Turtle Space Control</strong> to maintain your ability to apply alternating <strong>Shotput</strong>-powered <strong>Bridge and Shrimp</strong> movements onto an opponent you are <strong>Connected</strong> to, <strong>Timed</strong> contrary to an established <strong>Pattern</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is an awkward mouthful, stringing together the seven fundamentals of FJJ2 into a single sentence.  I'll explain each of these later in the document.</p>
        <p>I want to explain the theory behind fake jiu jitsu generally first, but feel free to follow the links if you just want to see what the deal is.</p>
