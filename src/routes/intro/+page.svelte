    <p>Hello, and thank you for your interest in Fake Jiu Jitsu!  Sometime in 2020 I stopped trying to actually learn Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and started just faking it.  Itâ€™s been much more fun than learning how to do the real thing, and I would argue it has not hindered my development as a grappler.</p>
    <p>This document is my attempt to express my ideas clearly, both for my own growth and to help any other grapplers asking the forbidden questions of BJJ.</p>
