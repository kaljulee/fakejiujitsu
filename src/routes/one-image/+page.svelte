    <p>Many people have created excellent <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bjj+mind+maps">mind maps of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</a>.  But even the best of these are either highly incomplete or highly complex (or both).</p>
    <p>I believe the reason BJJ is so hard to map is because it uses a sub-optimal set of fundamental reference points.</p>
    <p>Like a geocentric mapping of planetary movement, a Helio-centric mapping of BJJ results in a usable but unnecessarily complex system.</p>
    <p>Fake Jiu Jitsu proposes a different set of fundamentals, resulting in a much simpler mental map.</p>
